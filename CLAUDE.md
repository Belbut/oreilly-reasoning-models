# O'Reilly Reasoning Models Course

Course on reasoning models: building the DeepSeek R1-style training pipeline from scratch, plus OpenAI reasoning-model demo apps. Anthropic Claude extended thinking is covered conceptually in the slides.

## Structure

## Key APIs

**OpenAI (Responses API)**
```python
client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.6",
    reasoning={"effort": "medium"},  # none/low/medium/high/xhigh
    input=[{"role": "developer", "content": "..."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}]
)
```

**Anthropic (Extended Thinking)**
```python
client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-5",
    output_config={"effort": "medium"},
    messages=[...]
)
```

## Run

```bash
# Setup
uv venv .venv && uv pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt

# API keys in .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

## Conventions

- Notebooks use `dotenv` for API keys
- Code cells include print statements with `-` * 60 dividers
- Tables for parameter comparisons
- Pydantic for structured outputs
